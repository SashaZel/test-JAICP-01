# My test chatbot sandbox

Great integration with GitHub! I like it.

Strange test running. 
If I make test deploy - all are OK. But for the channels deploy there is an Error (with states /Greeting and /Hello - I made it with conscions intent)
Not pure behaiveor of test enviroment... Or I don't understand something.
